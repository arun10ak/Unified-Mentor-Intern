Green Destinations is a well-known travel agency. The HR Director has recently noticed an increase in employees leaving (attrition). She would like to figure out any trends or patterns. She has surveyed the staff of Green Destinations and provided you with the data. She would like to know what the attrition rate is (% of people who have left).

#### Key Insights :

1. **Age**: Uncover attrition patterns by age groups. Most attrition occurs in the 26-35 age group.

2. **Salary**: Analyze attrition relative to salary bands. The highest attrition is seen in employees earning up to 5K.

3. **Years of Service**: Spot trends based on employee tenure. Attrition spikes after one year with the company.

4. **Education**: Explore attrition data by educational background. Life Sciences Education has a 38% attrition rate.

5. **Job Role**: Discover which roles face higher attrition. Laboratory technicians have the highest attrition rate at 62%.

6. **Gender**: Compare attrition rates between genders. It's higher for males compared to females.

7. **Job Satisfaction**: Attrition is linked to job satisfaction across roles. Lower satisfaction means higher attrition risk.
